Marketing-information managers can protect the integrity of the information they\r\ncollect by interpreting it correctly and not manipulating it in such a way that it agrees with a predetermined\r\nconclusion. Protecting the integrity of marketing information is sometimes difficult because researchers often\r\ncan make the information support either side of an issue depending on how they interpret it. Most researchers\r\ntry to interpret the information correctly because consumers are sometimes suspicious of research findings that\r\nseem to support the opinions of the business that sponsors the research. Researchers do not protect the\r\nintegrity of marketing information by reviewing it frequently, publishing it openly, or organizing it logically.\r\nSOURCE: IM:025 Explain the role of ethics in marketing-information management\r\nSOURCE: Fuggle, L.

Amplified word-of-mouth promotion involves the use of\r\nproactive efforts (campaigns) in which the business provides specific information to customers (activists) to\r\npass along to their friends, family, and business contacts. On the other hand, organic word-of-mouth promotion\r\noccurs naturally. Because customers are satisfied with the business and its products, they tell others about this\r\nsatisfaction in the course of normal conversation. For example, if a business shows a sincere interest in the\r\ncustomer by asking for feedback, taking actions to ensure customer loyalty, or improving products, the\r\ncustomer is likely to share those positive experiences with others.\r\nSOURCE: PR:247 Describe word-of-mouth channels used to communicate with targeted audiences\r\nSOURCE: Meyers, J.

In other cases, it might be better for the business to have the supplier pay\r\nthe charges and own the goods until they are delivered to the business.

In many situations, producers will\r\nassist other channel members (e.g., dealers, distributors, retailers) in sales promotions. One way to assist\r\nchannel members planning a sales promotion in a certain area is by providing resources (e.g., money, product\r\nsamples) to develop an advertising campaign. The goal of the advertising campaign is to communicate\r\ninformation about the sales promotion to consumers in order to stimulate interest and sales.
